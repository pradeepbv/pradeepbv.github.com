I have been trying to learn JavaScript for quite sometime now. Started with [JavaScript Fundamentals][1] track on [Codecademy][2] but somehow I didn't make much progress. 

And today I came across this tweet from [Nicholas C. Zakas][3]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Love this: @<a href="https://twitter.com/jscriptissexy">jscriptissexy</a> taught his 13 yo daughter JavaScript using my book, @<a href="https://twitter.com/__davidflanagan">__davidflanagan</a>'s book, and @<a href="https://twitter.com/codeacademy">codeacademy</a> <a href="http://t.co/43sC7gUm" title="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-j…</a></p>&mdash; Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet) <a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/244615857853054976" data-datetime="2012-09-09T01:58:59+00:00">September 9, 2012</a></blockquote>

In [How to Learn JavaScript Properly][4], [Richard Bovell][4] explains how not to learn JavaScript. This essentially listed the factors that lead to failures in my earlier attempts (rather half-attempts) to learn JavaScript. 

And then I saw this: 

> This is a proven method, my 13-year-old daughter followed these guidelines and she has successfully learned JavaScript to the extent that she works for me in her spare time on some small, professional JavaScript projects. Even though she hasn’t completed all the advanced chapters below, she has still learned enough of the language that she knows how to use JavaScript as a tool.

I am planning to follow the footsteps of the 13-year-old. 

#### Wish me luck.
