    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that I learning how to become a developer I have come across a peculiar problem. Hoe to manage code? I mean when you try to write something and it doesn't do what you need it to do you end up writing variants of the same thing and call it test1, test2, testupdatedv1, trial3, trialwith3 etc. And soon you will be lost in a mess.</p>

<p>One way to manage code is to use a source control system. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is one of the popular source control system used in projects large and small.</p>

<p>I am attempting to learn <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. There are couple of books that I have been recommended to me as good starting points.</p>

<h3>Pro Git</h3>

<h3>Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying to learn JavaScript for quite sometime now. Started with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">JavaScript Fundamentals</a> track on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> but somehow I didn't make much progress.</p>

<p>And today I came across this tweet from <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">Nicholas C. Zakas</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Love this: @<a href="https://twitter.com/jscriptissexy">jscriptissexy</a> taught his 13 yo daughter JavaScript using my book, @<a href="https://twitter.com/__davidflanagan">__davidflanagan</a>'s book, and @<a href="https://twitter.com/codeacademy">codeacademy</a> <a href="http://t.co/43sC7gUm" title="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-j…</a></p>&mdash; Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet) <a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/244615857853054976" data-datetime="2012-09-09T01:58:59+00:00">September 9, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>In <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">How to Learn JavaScript Properly</a>, <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">Richard Bovell</a> explains how not to learn JavaScript. This essentially listed the factors that lead to failures in my earlier attempts (rather half-attempts) to learn JavaScript.</p>

<p>And then I saw this:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a proven method, my 13-year-old daughter followed these guidelines and she has successfully learned JavaScript to the extent that she works for me in her spare time on some small, professional JavaScript projects. Even though she hasn’t completed all the advanced chapters below, she has still learned enough of the language that she knows how to use JavaScript as a tool.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am planning to follow the footsteps of the 13-year-old.</p>

<h4>Wish me luck.</h4>
